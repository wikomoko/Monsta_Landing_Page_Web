# Monsta_Landing_Page_Web
This is a Monsta Landing Page Web, it also a single landing page and it was built by using Bootstrap 4, Jquery, and several customize css and html. It is actually the personal project, but everyone can use it or any purposes. All of assets in this project (images) was created by us. So there is no copyright of the image. We also serve the .svg files. So everyone can edit them whatever the purposes.

Here is the screenshot of the Project (This is Responsive, so it also look pretty good although it is opened by mobile phone):
